# Comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives

In chapter 17, I find out some pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives. Those QA alternatives are defect prevention, inspection, formal verification, fault tolerance, failure containment, etc.

##Testing vs Defect prevention
* Object: code vs implementation.
* Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs implementation.
* Expertise level: low-high vs medium-high.
* Observation: failures vs errors & error sources.
* Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs systematic errors or conceptual mistakes.
* Result interpretation: moderate vs intangible.
* Cost: medium(low-high) vs low.

##Testing vs Inspection
* Object: code vs design,code and other software artifacts.
* Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs all.
* Expertise level: low-high vs low-medium.
* Observation: failures vs faults.
* Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs static & localized faults.
* Result interpretation: moderate vs easy.
* Cost: medium(low-high) vs low-medium.

##Testing vs Formal verification
* Object: code vs design/code with formal specification.
* Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs design/coding.
* Expertise level: low-high vs high.
* Observation: failures vs (absence of) faults.
* Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs local faults.
* Result interpretation: moderate vs hard.
* Cost: medium(low-high) vs high.

##Testing vs Fault tolerance	
* Object: code vs operational software system.
* Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs in-field operation.
* Expertise level: low-high vs high.
* Observation: failures vs local failures.
* Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs operational failures in small areas.
* Result interpretation: moderate vs hard.
* Cost: medium(low-high) vs high.

##Testing vs Failure containment
* Object: code vs system with potential accidents.
* Development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs in-field operation.
* Expertise level: low-high vs high.
* Observation: failures vs accidents.
* Problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs accidents and related hazards.
* Result interpretation: moderate vs hard.
* Cost: medium(low-high) vs highest.
