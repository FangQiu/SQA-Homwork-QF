#week5--my understanding of formal methods in general and model checking in particular
## formal methods
Formal methods include formal specification techniques and formal verification techniques. These are all based on mathematical representation and analysis of software. Formal specifications are expressed in a mathematical notation with precisely defined vocabulary, syntax and semantics. Formal verification checks the conformance of software design or code to its formal specifications described above, thus ensuring that the software is fault-free with respect to its formal specifications. The use of formal methods can be summarized in the following two-step process:
* Constructing formal specifications: The expected behavior and other properties of the software artifacts are represented in formal models. These models of program code, design, and expected behavior are typically product-dependent, which can be specifically constructed for formal verification and analysis purposes. 
* Performing formal verifications: Formal analysis techniques are applied on the product components, typically product code or formal designs, to verify their correctness with respect to their formal specifications, or to check for certain properties. 
## model checking
Model checking is such an approach that automatically or algorithmically checks certain properties for some software systems. The model checker is a software that runs an algorithm to check the validity of the proposition. If it is checked to be true, a proof is said to be produced. Otherwise, a counterexample is given, much like a failed test case that can be analyzed further for defect fixing. Model checking combines algorithmic checking of propositions through execution with formal assertions stated as the propositions with respect to software systems modeled as finite-state machines.
