#My understanding of SQA (13126120 邱芳)

I have learn software developing about four years, but I haven't choose the SQA (Software Quality Assurance) class. I know about SQA in many other class, like software engineer management, software testing and so on.

SQA's aim is to discover the problem as soon as possible, and require the project team to improve and follow up until resolved. In my opinion, SQA is useful at each stage of software developing. At the end of each stage, it has some rules to follow, people should walkthrough the project and write some documents to ensure that the project as planned. And most members in the project should be attended. In the different stage of the software life cycle, the task of SQA is different. Testing is only one part of SQA.
